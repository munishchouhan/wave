title: Architectures

Computational workloads can be executed across a variety of CPU hardware architectures. The two most commonly used architectures in modern computing environments are `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. These architectures are based on distinct CPU instruction sets, each offering specific benefits and suited for different use cases:

`linux/amd64`:

- Traditional x86-64 architecture.
- Widely adopted in traditional server, desktop, and high-performance computing environments.

`linux/arm64`:

- 64-bit extension of the ARM architecture.
- Increasingly popular in modern computing environments.

[ARM architectures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture_family) (`arm64`) have gained significant popularity in recent years due to their inherent advantages in energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness. ARM processors are designed to deliver high performance per watt, making them attractive for cloud providers and organizations aiming to optimize operational costs and reduce their environmental impact.

Leading cloud providers have embraced ARM architectures as part of their infrastructure offerings:

- AWS Graviton
- Azure Cobalt
- Google Cloud Axion

ARM adoption is rapidly expanding in fields such as bioinformatics and data science, where workloads are computationally intensive and cost-sensitive.
Wave supports the on-demand provisioning of container images for both `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` architectures. This multi-architecture support ensures broad compatibility across heterogeneous execution environments and allows users to:

- Optimize pipeline execution for specific hardware platforms.
- Reduce infrastructure costs by leveraging ARM-based instances.
- Improve energy efficiency and sustainability in large-scale data processing workflows.

:::note
`linux/arm64` is distinct from Apple Silicon, for example, M1/M2 chips, despite both being based on ARM architectures. Apple Silicon leverages a unique system-on-chip design optimized for macOS environments, whereas `linux/arm64` is a broader specification used across various Linux distributions in server and cloud contexts.  Wave does not currently support building images for `macos/arm64`.
