Containers are an essential part of modern data analysis pipelines. They encapsulate applications and dependencies in portable, self-contained packages that can be easily distributed across diverse computing environments. 

Containers enable predictable and reproducible scientific results. However, scientific data pipelines comprise tens of distinct container images, each requiring careful management to ensure they align with task requirements.
To use containers, developers face an added burden in building, uploading, and monitoring containers to address security vulnerabilities.

Wave streamlines the provision of software containers by providing a unified solution to manage the full lifecycle of container images and integrate them with data pipelines.
It allows container provisioning on demand, removing the need to build, upload, and scan containers for security vulnerabilities manually.

Wave can provision both disposable containers, which are ephemeral and accessible only for a limited duration, and regular, long-term, registry-persisted container images.

Wave can be used directly in your Nextflow data pipelines, via Wave CLI or Wave API, and by using [Seqera Containers](./seqera-containers.mdx).
To get started with Wave:

- Learn about using [Wave with Nextflow](https://docs.seqera.io/wave/nextflow), the [Wave CLI](https://docs.seqera.io/wave/cli), and the [Wave API](https://docs.seqera.io/wave/api).
- Learn about [Seqera Containers](./seqera-containers.mdx)

Wave is a free hosted service available to anyone. However, users authenticated via [Seqera Platform](https://cloud.seqera.io/) have higher rate limits. Wave is open-source software licensed under AGPL-3.0.

:::note
Wave is open-source software and can be self-hosted. It has tight integration with Seqera Platform and requires access to either Seqera Cloud or Seqera Enterprise. [Contact us](https://seqera.io/contact-us/) for more information.
